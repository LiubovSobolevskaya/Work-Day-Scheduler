# Work Day Scheduler

5th challenge of the UCB Extension Bootcamp
_______________________________________

If you use a daily planner to create a schedule, the planner will display the current day at the top of the calendar when you open it. As you scroll down, you will see timeblocks for standard business hours. Each timeblock for the current day will be color coded to show whether it is in the past, present, or future. If you click on a timeblock, you can enter an event and save it by clicking the save button. The planner will store the event in your computer's memory, so even if you refresh the page, the saved events will still be there.
